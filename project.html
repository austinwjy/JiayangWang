in Greater Toronto Area <a href="project2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> <a href="project2_vedio_presentation.mp4" target="_blank">vedio presentation</a></p> In 2020, people are facing a huge global pandemic, COVID-19, where Toronto is one of the most affected cities in Canada. The real estate in GTA has been seriously affected, and the price of detached houses is at the highest level in history. First-time home buying has become the main problem for the federal government. This leads us to investigate into the sale price of detached houses. Using the dataset from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) on detached houses, we build SLR models to predict the sale price of properties by list price in two separate neighbourhoods, Toronto and Mississauga, to help buyers predict the expected sale price of detached houses.</li>

    	<li><p>Analysis of number of total children in Canadian family by <b>Stratified Survey Linear Regression</b> <a href="project4.pdf" target="_blank">report</a></p>As the fertility declines, population aging will likely lead to a decline in sustainable development capacity and increased financial pressures in a country. This leads us to investigate into the total number of children in a family for studying the fertility trends and natural population growth in Canada. Using the dataset from the 2017 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on families, we build a linear regression model to predict
the total number of children of a respondent, and analyze how it is affected by other factors, such as age,
sex, education, etc. According to the results of the model, the factors,which significantly impact childrenâ€™s
number in a Canadian family, should be taken seriously when concerning about the natural growth rate of
population and the aging of population.</li>
<li><p>Predicting the overall popular vote of the 2020 American federal election (Donald Trump v.s. Joe Biden) by <b>Multilevel Regression with Post-Stratification</b> <a href="project5.pdf" target="_blank">report</a></p>We are interested in predicting the overall popular vote of the 2020 American federal election using a regression model with post-stratification, which is a statistical method to predict population by sample data. Since survey data is randomly sampled, we choose to use a logistic regression model with post-stratification. MRP is mostly used for predicting population by non-representative data.</li>
<li><p>Predicting the 2019 Canadian Federal
Election by <b>Multilevel Regression with Post-Stratification</b> <a href="project6.pdf" target="_blank">report</a></p>The Liberal party won the 2019 Canadian federal election with 6,018,728 votes of total 18,170,880 valid votes. This paper focuses on exploring the 2019 Canadian federal election results assuming the whole Canadian population will vote as valid votes. By the datasets from Canadian Election Study (CES) and the General Social Survey (GSS), to predict the overall popular votes of the 2019 Canadian federal election, using a regression model with post-stratification (MRP) which is a statistical method to predict population by sample data, and then compare the results of the prediction with the true results of 2019 election to find out the performance of the model and study the importance of difference in results.</li>
<li><p>Investigating the factors that affect table salt dissolve time by <b>Factorial Experiment</b> (This is what I'm currently working on) <a href="proposal.pdf" target="_blank">proposal</a></p>Table salt is an essential seasoning in daily meals. It dissolves at different times when it is added to different foods. In this experiment, I am interested in examining three factors that affect table salt dissolve time. The three factors are temperature, stirring rate, and amount of solvent.</li>
